# Scatter_X_Y_Grapher
This program takes 2 sets of data from a csv file to plot x_y 2D scatter graph. The progam treats the first data set as x_axis and the second as y_axis; furthermore,
it plots the data using Ellipse shape. The program provides reasonably precise data representation.
The program will work with any csv file that has the same design as the one provided.

The program still needs to undergo few edits/fixes.
