# Simple-X_Y-Grapher
This ptogram takes 2 sets of data from a csv file to plot on x_y 2D graph. The progam treats the first read data set as x_axis and the second as y_axis; furthermore,
it plots the data using Elipse shape. The program provides reasonably precise data representation.
The program will work with any csv file that has the same design as the one provided.

The program might still need to undergo few fixes.
